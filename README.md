This project represents the culminating endeavor of the course at **[iTransition Software Company](https://www.itransition.com)**.

I have named this project "Digitopia Quest". Below, I will provide a detailed list of requirements along with my personal explanations for each step.

*"WEB PORTAL FOR REVIEWS "WHAT SHOULD U READ/WATCH/PLAY, etc."
Front: TypeScript/JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB, Bootstrap
.NET: C#/ASP.NET Core MVC/Entity Framework/SQL Server/MySQL/PostgreSQL, Bootstrap*

>Digitopia Quest is the web portal that provides reviews and recommendations for various types of entertainment such as books, movies, TV shows, and games. The portal should be designed to help users decide what to read, watch, play, and so on, based on the opinions of other users who have already experienced those forms of entertainment.

>The development technologies for this project include both frontend and backend components. The backend requires .NET Core 7, while the frontend will utilize Bootstrap and Blazor. The database will be built using MSSQL.
